    <p>This policy, which is subject to change, applies to remote data access. This policy does not apply to local data access.</p>
    
    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>All Nearcast data (quality-controlled observations, augmentation with additional network data, metadata & proprietary forecasts) is available to station owners from stations that they own (public or private) via any application for personal use only. No Nearcast data (observations, forecast or metadata) is available from private stations via any application. Metadata from public stations is available with a <a href="https://weatherflow.com/professional-services/one/">TempestONE</a> subscription. Observation and forecast data from public stations is available via a <a href="https://weatherflow.com/professional-services/one/">TempestONE</a> subscription.</p>
