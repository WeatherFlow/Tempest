    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p>All data (qualilty-controlled observations, augmentation with additional network data, metadata & proprietary forecasts) is available to station owners from stations that they own (public or private) via any application for personal use. No data (observations, forecast or metadata) is available from private stations via any application. Metadata from public stations is available to any user via any application. Observation and forecast data from public stations may be available to any user via licensed commercial applications (please <a href="https://weatherflow.com/partner-inquiry/">contact us</a> for details).</p>
