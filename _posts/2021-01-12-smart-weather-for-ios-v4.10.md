More Data at the top of the Main View
- The “More Current Conditions” section at the bottom of the Main View has always been a great way to see more data from your station. In this release, we are moving a few of those key values up to the Top Box on the Main View. In addition to the wind and UV values, now you can quickly see the humidity, pressure and pressure trend right when you open the app. If it is raining or there is recent lightning in your area, you will also see those data points in the Top Box as well.

Rapid Wind Updates
- Rapid Wind (wind speed & direction values reported every three seconds) is making its way to the Top Box of the Main View! In addition, the rapid wind display on the Card View has received an update to match the new rapid wind visualization on the Main View.
Additional bug fixes and minor performance enhancements are also included in this build.
