History View Expansion
We have added weekly, monthly, yearly and all time statistics for your devices.

Better Forecast UI Improvements
We streamlined the UI so that we are not displaying the same information in multiple places.  We also added sunrise and sunset data to each forecast day.

Station Dashboard
The Station Dashboard is now home to the More Current Conditions section that was previously on the Forecast view.  This puts all of your detailed station information in one place.
