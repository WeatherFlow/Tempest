This build includes primarily bug fixes and performance enhancements.  Here are a few of the bugs we squashed with this release:

- Fixed issue with negative lightning distance display
- Fixed precision issue with rain accumulation display in the More Current Conditions section of the Forecast view
- Fixed app crash for users who had zero winds in their hourly forecast. (Those calm winds really tripped us up!)
