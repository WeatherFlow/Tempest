Weâ€™re constantly working to improve your Tempest experience. In addition bug fixes and performance enhancements, we have added National Weather Service Watches, Warnings and Advisories to this release.

If there is an active Watch, Warning or Advisory issued by the NWS for your station or a  saved location, you will now see that information on the main forecast screen.  Tapping the Watch, Warning or Advisory will show you the full detailed information as provided by the NWS (U.S. only).
